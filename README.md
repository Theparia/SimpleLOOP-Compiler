# SimpleLOOP-Compiler

The language `SimpleLOOP` is an **object-oriented language** and has some features of object-oriented language such as **inheritance**. In this language, there is a `Main` class in which an `initialize` method is implemented. The programs written in this language execute the commands inside this method when they are executed.

## Sample Program in SimpleLOOP
```C++
class Person {
    private int id, age
    public initialize(int id, int age) {
        self.id = id
        self.age = age
    }
    public void showId()
    print(self.id)
}
class Employee < Person {
    private int salary
    private bool privileged
    public initialize(int id, int age, bool privileged, int salary) {
        self.id = id
        self.age = age
        self.privileged = privileged
        self.salary = salary
    }
    public void showSalary() {
        if !self.privileged
        print(self.salary)
        else
            print(0)
    }
}

class Main {
    public initialize() {
        Employee e
        e = Employee.new(10, 37, false, 300000)
        e.showSalary()
        e.showId()
    }
}
```
## Phase 1 (Lexer)
* **Grammar** specification

## Phase 2 (Name Analysis)
* **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**
* **Errors**
  * Redefinition of class \<ClassName>
  * Redefinition of local variable \<VariableName>
  * Redefinition of field \<FieldName>
  * Redefinition of method \<MethodName>
  * Name of method \<MethodName> conflicts with a field's name
  * Redefinition of global variable \<VariableName>
  * Name of local variable \<VariableName> conflicts with a global variableâ€™s name
  * Class \<ClassName> is in an inheritance cycle

## Phase 3 (Type-Checking)
* **Errors**
  * Variable \<VariableName> is not declared
  * Class \<ClassName> is not declared
  * There is no member named \<VariableName> in class \<ClassName>
  * Condition must be bool
  * Left side of the assignment must be a valid lvalue
  * Lvalue is required as the operand of \<OperatorName>
  * Calling a non-callable
  * Unsupported type for print
  * ...

## Phase 4 (Code Generation)
* Program translation to **bytecode**
* Generate .class files using [jasmin](https://jasmin.sourceforge.net/) assembler
